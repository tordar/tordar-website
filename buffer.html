        <p>Why do I still include this absolutely obnoxious piece of web design together with my portfolio website?
            This is just another typical, code-as-you-learn HTML and CSS dumping ground anyways right?</p>
        <p>Well, that's true. But it's still something I'm very proud of. When I first set out to teach myself how to
            code, I had absolutely zero clue where to start. I have received very little coaching, and have for the
            most part taught myself everything I know. And this was an essential part of my journey. From the very
            first euphoria of typing <b>print("Hello world")</b> into Python and seeing the outcome, to whichever given
            point I am right now. This is something I have truly set my mind to, and when I eventually find myself
            in my first professional position, I will know where I came from and everything it took to get there.
