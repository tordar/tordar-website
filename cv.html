    <h4>Other</h4>
        <p>Interests: </br> Running, programming, photography, politics, music, staying in shape, learning new things, reading (classic literature, philosophy, fiction, non-fiction), constantly challenging myself and travelling
            to new destinations.</p>
        <p>Volunteering: </br>From October 2015, until December 2016 I was volunteering in Greece and Lebanon, during the migration crisis. This involved e.g. contributing to establishing a new NGO (Northern Lights Aid),
            controlling and coordinating distributions in crisis areas, performing crisis emergency aid and co-ordinating teams of volunteers in emergency situations. Here, I worked for several different
            grassroot NGOs (Drop in the Ocean, Northern Lights Aid, Intervolve), and found myself thriving in stressful and difficult working environments.</p>
        <p>Model United Nations: </br> Harvard National Model United Nations 2019 - Represented Indonesia in World Health Organization, where I was nominated for both best speaker and most diplomatic. </br>
            Model United Nations of The Hague 2019 - Represented Dominican Republic in Security Council, where I received a Verbal Commendation. </p>
        <p>What makes me unique?: </br> I have all my adult life had a constant drive to put myself in new and potentially uncomfortable situations. This started with going on an exchange year in high
            school and eventually brought me into several interesting new settings, such as volunteering in refugee camps, studying abroad, debating with Ivy League students at prestigious conferences
            and even working for a green energy company in Madagascar. </p>
