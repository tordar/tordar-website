            "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now." </br> Ancient Chinese proverb
        </p>
        <p class="journal">Since the beginning of my last academic year at university, I decided to dedicate myself fully to learn how to code. This is something I have wanted be able to do since I was a teenager, but I
            always let my impatience for learning difficult things, and lack of technical skills hold me back. The process of beginning to learn something completely new can be very intimidating.
            At the beginning of learning any new skill, you feel humbled by the seemingly mountainous task of knowledge you must obtain and walls you must break through, before you even have a
            basic understanding of what goes into it. I mean, people get university degrees to do this right? Well, after being curios about coding for the past few years, I decided it was time
            to dive in.

            This has very much been a learn-as-you-go journey so far. It has been one of the steepest learning curves I've ever experienced, and every single day I seem to learn something
            new that takes my understanding of the subject to a whole new level. I started with a tutorial on Python, tried to understand as much as possible there, and from there have
            moved on to the next logical steps, HTML and CSS. I have tried to create as much on my own as possible, especially this website you are reading now.
        </p>

            When struck by a new passion, it can be easy to rush into different areas and go where the wind takes you. One of the biggest challenges seems to be to simply trust
            the process I have started on. Knowing that great things take time, accepting the opportunities that arise, the challenges that come with them, and having the patience to wait for progress.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/tordar/tordar-website" target="_blank">Website</a></h3>
        <p class="journal">The first published project I'm working on is this website. After publishing the repository on Github I hosted the website through Github Pages, which seems to do just fine for my hosting
            purposes as for now. I will most likely change this later. Follow the link for source code (opens in new tab).
