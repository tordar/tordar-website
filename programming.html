            "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now." </br> Ancient Chinese proverb
        </p>
        <p class="journal">Since the beginning of my last academic year at university, I decided to dedicate myself
            fully to learn how to code. This is something I have wanted be able to do since I was a teenager, but I
            had always let my impatience for learning difficult things, and lack of technical skills hold me back. The
            process of beginning to learn something completely new can be very intimidating.
            At the beginning of learning any new skill, you feel humbled by the seemingly mountainous task of knowledge
            you must obtain and walls you must break through, before you even have a
            basic understanding of what goes into it. I mean, people get university degrees to do this right? Well,
            after being curious about coding for the past few years, I decided it was time
            to dive in. What I found was almost instantly a new great passion.
        </p>
        <p class="journal">
            This has very much been a learn-as-you-go journey so far. It has been one of the steepest learning curves
            I've ever experienced, and every single day I seem to learn something
            new that takes my understanding of the subject to a whole new level. I started with a tutorial on Python,
            tried to understand as much as possible there, and from there have
            moved on to the next seemingly logical steps, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have tried to create as much on my
            own as possible, especially this website you are reading now.
        </p>
        <p class="journal">
            When struck by a new passion, it can be easy to rush into different areas and go where the wind takes you.
            One of the biggest challenges seems to be to simply trust
            the process I have started on. Knowing that great things take time, accepting the opportunities that arise,
            the challenges that come with them, and having the patience to wait for progress.

        <p class="journal">
            The first published project I'm working on is this website. After publishing the repository on Github I
            hosted the website through Github Pages, which seems to do just fine for my hosting
            purposes as for now. I will most likely change this later. Follow the link for source code (opens in new
            tab).

        <p class="journal">
            One of the first tutorial project in Python I was able to add and modify a few things myself. One of the
            changes was creating a batch file that would automatically run the script on startup.
            Learned a lot from doing this. Ran into several problems, but it seems like every time I learn something
            new, I can come back to this program and improve on something.

        <p class="journal">
            Through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">freecodecamp's</a> coding curriculum
            I've completed several projects as part of their responsive web design course. These have been published
            on my Codepen profile, where they are showcased with HTML and CSS code easily available. To date, I've
            created a tribute page, survey form, a portfolio, technical documentation site and a product landing page.
            These websites were each created in one sitting, and is simply meant to showcase different abilities.

        <h3><a href="flipper/simple.html">Color flipper</a></h3>
        <p class="journal">
            This is a simple color flipper. This was my first JavaScript project. Here, I learned about concepts like
            getElementById, querySelector, addEventListener. These I will be able to use more freely going forward, when
            working with JavaScript.
